Smart Access Control project, revolutionizing the gym access experience! Our cutting-edge system ensures seamless entry into the gym for users who have paid for the current period. Say goodbye to manual check-ins and enjoy a streamlined access process with the power of technology.

🚪 How It Works:
Each client is provided with an RFID tag for easy identification.
Users simply present their RFID tag to the device at the gym entrance.
Our intelligent system instantly verifies if the user has paid for the current period.
If the payment is validated, the door is automatically opened, granting access to the gym.

💻 User-Friendly Management:
To ensure smooth operation, we have developed both a web application and a Windows Forms application (for those who prefer local management) to empower gym administrators with effortless client management:

🌐 Web Application:
Create, edit, and delete client profiles.
Manage payment status and membership periods.
Generate reports to track gym attendance and revenue.

🖥 Windows Forms Application:
For clients who prefer local data management.
Provides all the features available in the web application.
Ensures data security and control without reliance on the cloud.

📈 Benefits:
Improved Efficiency: Eliminate long queues and manual entry processes, reducing wait times for clients.
Enhanced Security: Only users with valid payment can access the gym, ensuring a safe and controlled environment.
Client Retention: Simplified payment extensions and management contribute to improved customer satisfaction.
Data Insights: Generate comprehensive reports to analyze gym performance and make informed decisions.
